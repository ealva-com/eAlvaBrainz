 * A query is broken up into terms and operators. There are two types of terms: Single Terms and

 * * Multiple terms can be combined together with Boolean operators to form a more complex query
 *
 * Lucene supports single and multiple character wildcard searches within single terms (not within
 * phrase queries). To perform a single character wildcard search use the "?" symbol. To perform a
 * multiple character wildcard search use the "*" symbol.
